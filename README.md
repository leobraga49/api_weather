## Challenge: Building a Simple Weather Forecast API

You are tasked with developing a simple weather forecast API using Java and the Spring Boot framework. The API should provide weather information for a given location.

### Requirements:

1. Integrate with a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, or any other of your choice). You'll need to sign up for an API key.
2. Implement a single API endpoint that accepts a location parameter (e.g., city name, zip code, latitude/longitude) and returns the current weather forecast for that location.
3. The API response should include relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy).
4. Handle any errors or invalid requests gracefully and return appropriate error messages or status codes.
5. Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your API endpoint(s).
6. Implement basic logging to record API requests and responses.

### Extra Credit (Optional):

1. Implement caching to store previously fetched weather data for a certain period, reducing the number of requests to the weather API provider.
2. Add additional endpoints to retrieve the weather forecast for multiple days or provide forecasts for different time intervals (e.g., hourly forecast).

You are encouraged to use any additional libraries or tools commonly used with Spring Boot to complete the challenge.
